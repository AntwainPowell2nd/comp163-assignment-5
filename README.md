I chose a while loop for the first because i was ussure of what the inputs would be so I oculdnt tell how many times the sequence would have to run so using awhile loop with a condition was better. Ichose a for loop for the second and third tasks because there waa a specific range that i needded to go through for both and the for loop is better suited for that. 
my solutins work by first sorting the numbers into odd or even numbers by if statments then executing thier respective exuations all this continues untill the while statment becomes false than all while printin out each increments result. The second one has a range of numbers specified by the input and cycles though those numbers using the modulo the divide into the input number if it eventualy equals zero it will print the required statment with the number that made it zero because that is the divisor, if this if stattment fails it will automaticly prints out the input is a prime number. the third task uses nested for loops to pritn the row and miltiply every number in the middle to print out the multiplication table with well placed print statments to create the levels
I used AI to help me format the prime numbers correctly at first they were repeating and putting numbers as [rime when they were not so I needed help with that.
